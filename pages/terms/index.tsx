          <b>GOATz Terms of Use and License Agreement</b>
          <br/>
          This GOATz License Agreement (this “Agreement”) is a legally binding agreement by and between KRHFT Studios LLC, Inc., a
          California LLC (“KRHFT Studios LLC” or “us”) and any owner of any GOATz NFT(defined below) (“you” or “Purchaser”). KRHFT Studios LLC and each Purchaser may be referred to throughout this Agreement collectively as the “Parties” or individually as a
          “Party”. By purchasing or otherwise owning a GOATz NFT, you acknowledge that you have carefully read and agree to the terms
          of this Agreement.
          <br/>
          WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY
          DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND KRHFT STUDIOS LLC THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN
          COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTIONS 14 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING
          ARBITRATION. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
          ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN SECTION 14 WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU BUT THE
          PROVISIONS OF SECTION 13 (GOVERNING LAW) WILL APPLY INSTEAD.
          <br/>
          1. Agreement to Terms; Defined Terms. “GOATz NFT” refers to an ERC-721 standard non-fungible token (“NFT”) (i.e.,
          a controllable electronic record recorded on a blockchain) that, as of its genesis issuance, contains images of Generative Art as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the foregoing, “GOATz” shall include the NFTs
          located at the following Ethereum smart contract addresses: 0x3EAcf2D8ce91b35c048C6Ac6Ec36341aaE002FB9 and
          0xDA1011bb5a16b4032172b1CBC45Db31fDaAA18d0. 
          For avoidance of doubt, the GOATz Art is digital in nature and does not include, is not linked
          to, and is not sold together with, any items or representations that have physical dimensions such as mass or volume.
          (a) Additional Terms: GOATz may be available for purchase on one or more third-party platforms, such as
          OpenSea, Rarible or other marketplaces that may be established from time to time (each, a “NFT Marketplace”),
          which we do not operate. The access and use of the NFT Marketplace are subject to the separate terms of the NFT
          Marketplace.
          <br/>
          2. Ownership of GOATz. <br/>
          (a) When Purchaser acquires a GOATz, Purchaser owns all personal property rights to that GOATz (e.g.,
          the right to freely sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of that GOATz). Ownership does include the
          ownership of the intellectual property rights in the GOATz Art that is currently held by the owner. Such rights are licensed pursuant to Section 3
          below.
          (b) Purchaser represents and warrants that it will not transfer a GOATz in any subsequent transaction to a
          Transferee that is (i) located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated
          by the U.S. Government as a terrorist-supporting country; or is (ii) listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or
          restricted parties (“Prohibited Transferees”).
          <br/>
          3. License.<br/>
          (a) Commercial License. Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, KRHFT Studios LLC hereby grants to you,
          for so long as you own a GOATz (as recorded on the relevant blockchain), a non-exclusive, worldwide, royaltyfree, to use, copy, display and sell the GOATz Art linked to your purchased GOATz for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, use (e.g., home display, display in a
          virtual gallery, or as a social media avatar), including to create a reasonable number of back-up copies and a physical
          print out, each to be retained only for so long as you own the associated GOATz; and (ii) to sell or otherwise transfer
          the associated GOATz consistent with the ownership of it (e.g., posting a sales listing on an NFT marketplace). (iii) to sell or commercialize your owned GOATz art.
          (b) Transfer. The licenses in Section 3 are non-transferrable, except that they will automatically transfer in
          connection with a permitted transfer of the GOATz.
          <br/>
          4. Reservation of Rights.<br/>
          (a) General. All rights in and to the GOATz Logo and brand name as well as art not expressly provided for in this Agreement are hereby
          reserved by KRHFT Studios LLC. The GOATz Brand is licensed, not sold. KRHFT Studios LLC owns and will retain all title, interest,
          ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to the GOATz Brand. Without limitation, Purchaser shall
          not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt to, do any of the following without express prior written consent from
          KRHFT Studios LLC: (i) modify the GOATz brand except as expressly permitted herein; (ii) use the GOATz Brand as a
          brand or trademark or to advertise, market, or sell any product or service except to advertise, market or sell any
          Merchandise or works created from the exercise of your licenses to Generative Art in Section 3(d); (iii) use the
          GOATz brand in connection with media or merchandise that promotes hate speech, illegal activities, vulgarity (e.g.,
          pornography), offensive behavior, violence, cruelty or political statements; (iv) attempt to register any trademark,
          copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the GOATz brand; (v) represent or
          imply that your exercise of the licenses in Sections 3(c) or 3(d) is endorsed by or affiliated with KRHFT Studios LLC or any
          other party associated with GOATz; or (vi) make defamatory or dishonest statements about KRHFT Studios LLC or the
          GOATz or otherwise damage the goodwill, value or reputation of KRHFT Studios LLC or the GOATz.
          (b) No Rights to Trademarks. For avoidance of doubt, the licenses in Section 3 do not include the right to, and
          you may not, use any KRHFT Studios LLC trademarks (e.g. GOATZ, KRHFT STUDIOS LLC or the names of any GOATz)
          in connection with your exercise of the licenses in Section 3(c) or 3(d). No trademark or other rights based on
          designation of source or origin are licensed to you. You may not use or attempt to register any asset, including any
          domain names, social media accounts or related addresses, that contains or incorporates any artwork, other
          representation, name or mark that may be confusingly similar to such trademarks.
          (d) Enforcement. KRHFT Studios LLC reserves the exclusive right to: (i) register and otherwise protect all intellectual
          property and other rights in the GOATz Art and in any KRHFT Studios LLC trademarks and (ii) enforce the intellectual
          property rights in the GOATz Art and in any KRHFT Studios LLC trademarks.
          (e) Right to Interpret and Clarify. KRHFT Studios LLC and Purchaser recognize that the grant of rights reflected in Section
          3 and corresponding reservation of rights in Section 4 is novel, and unforeseen circumstances may require
          clarification. As such, KRHFT Studios LLC reserves the right to interpret and clarify the terms of this Agreement in relation to
          such circumstances in its sole and exclusive discretion.
          <br/>
          5. Transfers.<br/> All subsequent transactions of the GOATz are subject to the following terms: (a) the GOATz
          transferee (the “Transferee”) shall, by purchasing, accepting, accessing or otherwise using the GOATz or GOATz Art,
          be deemed to accept all of the terms of this Agreement as a “Purchaser” hereof; and (b) the GOATz transferor (the
          “Transferor”) shall provide notice to the Transferee of this Agreement, including a link or other method by which the terms of
          this Agreement can be accessible by the Transferee. Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that all subsequent
          transactions of the GOATz will be effected on the blockchain network governing the GOATz, and Purchaser will be
          required to make or receive payments exclusively through its cryptocurrency wallet.
          <br/>6. KRHFT Studios LLC’s Rights and Obligations to the GOATz Art and GOATz. The Parties acknowledge and
          agree that KRHFT Studios LLC is not responsible for repairing, supporting, replacing, or maintaining the website hosting the GOATz
          Art, nor does KRHFT Studios LLC have the obligation to maintain any connection or link between a GOATz and the corresponding
          GOATz Art.
          <br/>7. Warranty Disclaimers and Assumption of Risk. Purchaser represents and warrants that it (a) is the age of majority
          in Purchaser’s place of residence (which is typically 18 years of age in most U.S. states) and has the legal capacity to enter
          into this Agreement, (b) that Purchaser will use and interact with the GOATz and GOATz Art only for lawful purposes
          and in accordance with this Agreement, and (c) that Purchaser will not use the GOATz or GOATz Art to violate any
          law, regulation or ordinance or any right of KRHFT Studios LLC, its licensors or any third party, including without limitation, any right of
          privacy, publicity, copyright, trademark, or patent. Purchaser further agrees that it will comply with all applicable law.
          THE GOATZ ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
          FOREGOING, KRHFT STUDIOS LLC EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
          FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING
          OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. KRHFT STUDIOS LLC MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE
          GOATZ WILL MEET PURCHASER’S REQUIREMENTS OR BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE,
          OR ERROR-FREE BASIS. KRHFT STUDIOS LLC MAKES NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE QUALITY, ACCURACY,
          TIMELINESS, TRUTHFULNESS, COMPLETENESS OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION OR CONTENT ON THE
          GOATZ.
          KRHFT STUDIOS LLC WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO PURCHASER FOR ANY LOSS AND TAKES NO
          RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR, ANY USE OF THE GOATZ, INCLUDING BUT NOT
          LIMITED TO ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM: (I) USER ERROR SUCH AS FORGOTTEN
          PASSWORDS, INCORRECTLY CONSTRUCTED TRANSACTIONS, OR MISTYPED WALLET ADDRESSES; (II) SERVER
          FAILURE OR DATA LOSS; (III) CORRUPTED CRYPTOCURRENCY WALLET FILES; (IV) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO
          THE GOATZ; OR (V) ANY UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE
          USE OF VIRUSES, PHISHING, BRUTEFORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF ATTACK AGAINST BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK
          UNDERLYING THE GOATZ.
          THE GOATZ ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS. THEY EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP
          RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE APPLICABLE BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. ANY TRANSFER OF TITLE THAT MIGHT
          OCCUR IN ANY UNIQUE DIGITAL ASSET OCCURS ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN SUCH BLOCKCHAIN
          NETWORK, WHICH KRHFT STUDIOS LLC DOES NOT CONTROL. KRHFT STUDIOS LLC DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT KRHFT STUDIOS LLC
          CAN EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF TITLE OR RIGHT IN ANY GOATZ. PURCHASER BEARS FULL RESPONSIBILITY
          FOR VERIFYING THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, AND AUTHENTICITY OF ASSETS PURCHASER PURCHASES
          THROUGH THE NFT MARKETPLACE. NOTWITHSTANDING INDICATORS AND MESSAGES THAT SUGGEST
          VERIFICATION, KRHFT STUDIOS LLC MAKES NO CLAIMS ABOUT THE IDENTITY, LEGITIMACY, OR AUTHENTICITY OF
          ASSETS ON THE NFT MARKETPLACE OR ANY PURPORTED SUBSEQUENT TRANSACTIONS.
          KRHFT STUDIOS LLC IS NOT RESPONSIBLE ANY KIND OF FAILURE, ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR OF SOFTWARE (E.G., WALLET,
          SMART CONTRACT), BLOCKCHAINS OR ANY OTHER FEATURES OF THE GOATZ. KRHFT STUDIOS LLC IS NOT
          RESPONSIBLE FOR CASUALTIES DUE TO LATE REPORT BY DEVELOPERS OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR NO REPORT
          AT ALL) OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN SUPPORTING THE GOATZ, INCLUDING FORKS, TECHNICAL
          NODE ISSUES OR ANY OTHER ISSUES HAVING FUND LOSSES AS A RESULT.
          SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN CONTRACTS WITH
          CONSUMERS, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
          <br/>8. Assumption of Risk. Purchaser accepts and acknowledges all risks associated with the following:
          (a) Purchaser is solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to Purchaser’s purchase,
          sale, or transfer of the GOATz. KRHFT Studios LLC is not responsible for determining or paying the taxes that apply to
          such transactions.
          (b) KRHFT Studios LLC does not store, send, or receive cryptocurrency assets. Any transfer of cryptocurrency
          assets occurs within the supporting blockchain that is not controlled by KRHFT Studios LLC. Transactions of the GOATz
          may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.
          Some transactions of the GOATz shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public blockchain ledger,
          which is not necessarily the date or time that Purchaser initiated the transaction.
          (c) There are risks associated with using an Internet based digital asset, including but not limited to,
          the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that
          third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your Wallet. KRHFT Studios LLC will not be
          responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when
          effecting GOATz transactions, however caused.
          (d) Digital assets, including blockchain based assets such as the GOATz, are subject to
          developing laws and regulations throughout the world.
          (e) Transactions involving the GOATz may rely on third-party platforms to perform transactions.
          If KRHFT Studios LLC is unable to maintain a good relationship with such platform providers; if the terms and conditions or
          pricing of such platform providers change; if KRHFT Studios LLC violates or cannot comply with the terms and conditions of
          such platforms; or if any of such platforms loses market share or falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged
          period of time, access to and interactions of the GOATz will suffer.
          <br/>9. Links to Third Party Websites or Resources. Use and interaction of the GOATz and GOATz Art may
          allow Purchaser to access third-party websites (including websites that host the GOATz Art) or other resources. KRFHT
          Studios LLC provides access only as a convenience and is not responsible for the content, products or services on or available from
          those resources or links displayed on such websites. Purchaser acknowledges sole responsibility for and assumes all risk
          arising from Purchaser’s use of any third-party resources. Under no circumstances shall Purchaser’s inability to view
          GOATz Art on a third-party website serve as grounds for a claim against KRHFT Studios LLC.
          <br/>10. Termination of License to GOATz Art. Purchaser’s licenses to the GOATz Art shall automatically
          terminate and all rights shall revert to KRHFT Studios LLC if at any time: (a) Purchaser breaches any portion of this Agreement or (b)
          Purchaser engages in any unlawful activity related to the GOATz (including transferring the GOATz to a Prohibited
          Transferee). Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of Purchaser’s licenses to the GOATz Art, KRHFT Studios LLC
          may disable Purchaser’s access to the GOATz Art and Purchaser shall delete, remove, or otherwise destroy any back up
          or single digital or physical copy of the GOATz Art. Upon any termination, discontinuation or cancellation of the license in
          this Agreement, the following Sections will survive: 2, 4 through 17.
          <br/>11. Indemnity. Purchaser shall defend, indemnify, and hold KRHFT Studios LLC, its licensors and affiliates (the
          “Indemnified Parties”) harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, investigations, liabilities,
          judgments, fines, penalties, settlements, interest, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) that directly or indirectly arise
          from or are related to any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding made or brought by a third party (including any person
          who accesses or transacts using the GOATz whether or not such person personally purchased the GOATz)
          against the Indemnified Parties, or on account of the investigation, defense, or settlement thereof, arising out of or in
          connection with (a) your access to or use of the NFT Marketplace, (b) your breach of this Agreement, and (c) your exercise of
          the licenses in Section 3.
          <br/>12. Limitation of Liability.
          (a) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER KRHFT STUDIOS LLC NOR ITS SERVICE
          PROVIDERS, INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE GOATZ WILL BE LIABLE
          FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST
          PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR
          GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF
          SUBSTITUTE GOATZ OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR
          FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE OR INTERACT WITH THE GOATZ OR ACCESS THE
          GOATZ ART, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
          PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT KRHFT STUDIOS LLC OR ITS
          SERVICE PROVIDERS HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED
          REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
          (b) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE LAW OF THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION, IN NO
          EVENT WILL KRHFT STUDIOS LLC’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS
          OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE OR INTERACT WITH THE GOATZ OR ACCESS THE
          GOATZ ART EXCEED $10,000.
          (c) THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL
          ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN KRHFT STUDIOS LLC AND PURCHASER.
          <br/>13. Governing Law and Forum Choice. This Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of
          the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 14
          “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that Purchaser and KRHFT Studios LLC are not required
          to arbitrate will be the courts located in the State of California, and Purchaser and KRHFT Studios LLC each waive any objection to
          jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
          <br/>14. Dispute Resolution.
          (a) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. The Parties each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out
          of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof of the
          GOATz transaction (collectively, “Disputes”) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not
          in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and KRHFT Studios LLC agree that the Cayman
          Islands Arbitration Law governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement, and that you and KRHFT Studios LLC
          are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive
          termination of this Agreement.
          (b) Exceptions. As limited exceptions to Section 14(a) above: (i) both Parties may seek to resolve a Dispute in
          small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) both Parties each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief
          from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
          (c) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its JAMS
          Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this
          Agreement. The JAMS Rules are available at https://www.jamsadr.com/. A party who wishes to start arbitration must
          submit a written Demand for Arbitration to JAMS and give notice to the other party as specified in the JAMS Rules.
          JAMS provides a form Demand for Arbitration at https://www.jamsadr.com/.
          Any arbitration hearings will take place in Los Angeles, California, unless we both agree to a different location but, in
          any case, any such arbitration will be conducted remotely to the extent permitted by the JAMS Rules. The Parties
          agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability,
          enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.
          (d) Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS
          Rules, and KRHFT Studios LLC won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees KRHFT Studios LLC is responsible for
          paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If KRHFT Studios LLC prevails in arbitration KRHFT Studios LLC will pay for all
          of its attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled
          to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
          (e) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section 14(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine
          all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief
          only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that
          party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or KRHFT Studios LLC prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that
          is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to
          the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and
          not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the
          outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
          (f) Class Action Waiver. YOU AND KRHFT STUDIOS LLC AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
          OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
          ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved
          through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not
          otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be
          unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
          (g) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 14(f) of this Agreement (“Class Action
          Waiver”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this Agreement is invalid or
          unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement will still apply.
          <br/>15. Staking: KRHFT STUDIOS LLC, is not responsible for any lost property or value associated with errors made by the purchaser when using GOATz for staking or any other utility provided. Any direct interaction associated with the following staking contract will herby void any rights of the purchaser. KRFHT studios will not be responsible for any lost property or value associated with GOATz due to malicious exploit. 
          <br/>16. GMILK, the in-game currency for GOATz does not possess any equivalent real world monetary value and is only intended as a utility token with the GOATz brand and ecosystem. 
          <br/>17. General Terms. This Agreement will transfer and be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their
          permitted successors and assigns, in particular any Transferee. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and
          supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous representations, understandings and agreements, between the Parties with
          respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, all of which are hereby merged into this Agreement. Without limitation, the
          terms of any other document, course of dealing, or course of trade will not modify this Agreement, except as expressly provided
          in this Agreement or as the Parties may agree in writing. This Agreement may be amended by KRHFT Studios LLC in its absolute and
          sole discretion; provided, that KRHFT Studios LLC shall give notice of any material amendments to this Agreement to the holders of the
          GOATz NFTs through reasonable and public means (i.e., public post on a social media network, e.g., Twitter). Failure to
          promptly enforce a provision of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of such provision. Nothing contained in this
          Agreement will be deemed to create, or be construed as creating, a joint venture or partnership between the parties. Neither
          Party is, by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise, authorized as an agent or legal representative of the other Party. Neither
          Party to this Agreement is granted any right or authority to assume or to create any obligation or responsibility, express or
          implied, on behalf or in the name of the other party, or to bind such other Party in any manner. Nothing contained in this

          intent as manifested herein. The headings to Sections of this Agreement are for convenience or reference only and do not
          form a part of this Agreement and will not in any way affect its interpretation. Neither Party will be afforded or denied preference
          in the construction of this Agreement, whether by virtue of being the drafter or otherwise. For purposes of this Agreement, the
          words and phrases “include,” “includes”, “including” and “such as” are deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation”.
