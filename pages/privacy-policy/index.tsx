          Studios”, “we,” “us,” and “our”) collects, uses, and shares your personal information and to help you understand and exercise your privacy rights.
          This Privacy Policy applies to personal information collected and processed by KRHFT Studios LLCs website, which allows for the transacting of NFTs,
          staking of NFTs and other services as may be offered by KRHFT Studios LLC from time to time (collectively, the “Services”). For clarity, the Services do not

          transfer transactions will be conducted solely through the Ethereum Blockchain. Information about your transactions will be provided to
          the Ethereum Blockchain and may be accessible to third parties due to the public nature of the Ethereum Blockchain. Because entries to
          the Ethereum Blockchain are, by their nature, public, and because it may be possible for someone to identify you through your
          pseudonymous, public wallet address using external sources of information, any transaction you enter onto the Ethereum Blockchain could
          possibly be used to identify you, or information about you.

          read each third-party website or third-party application privacy policy before sharing your personal information or otherwise interacting
          with them. Please note that we do not control, and we are not responsible for the third-party websites or the third-party applications
          processing of your personal information.
          • Service Providers. We may share your personal information with our third-party service providers who use that information to help us

          Your Privacy Choices. The privacy choices you may have about your personal information are determined by applicable law and are described
          below.

          Policy).

          access to or a copy of your personal information; or (iii) receiving an electronic copy of personal information that you have provided
          to us, or asking us to send that information to another company (aka the right of data portability).

          tools that enable you to update your personal information.
          • Request Deletion of your personal information.

          with applicable laws.

          to your blockchain address and NFTs held at that address.
          6. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
          We take steps designed to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Unfortunately, no system
          is 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
          law, we do not accept liability for unauthorized disclosure.
          By using our Services or providing personal information to us, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding security,
          privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of our Services. If we learn of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you
          electronically by posting a notice on our Services, by mail or by sending an email to you.
          7. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS
          All information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including, but not limited to, the United States
          or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. We endeavor to safeguard your
          information consistent with the requirements of applicable laws.
          8. RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
